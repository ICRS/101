## Pre session

This lesson involves integrating the ultrasound sensors with the robots. Layout the arena and path for the robots. For our course we ended up using spare/broken desktop PCs as walls of the pathway for the robots because they are quite heavy - this came in handy as robots often tended to crash into the walls during testing.

## During Session

Explain how the ultrasound module works and is attached to the robot. Sample code is available to test that the robot fully functions. Make sure students are aware they can test their ultrasound sensors on the mini-arena that you set up before the session.

## Post session

Tidy up and debrief
