## Pre session

Session 3 is one of the most instructor-intensive sessions, as there's a large amount of learning for students to do, especially if they aren't familiar with programming. It may be worth ensuring that the table leaders are well versed in programming. If not, you can change a couple of helpers for this session. Ensure that all the instructors are familiar with Python - it is not a complicated language and the scope for this course is limited. Helpers should also know about the gpiozero library, which is what the course is taught with.

## During Session

The course leader should walk through the content; explaining what each line of code does and how they can be altered by the student. The reason to have the figure 8 coding exercise is to allow the students to become more comfortable coding.

## Post session

Tidy up and debrief
