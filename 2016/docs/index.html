  <h2 style="text-align: center">An open source robotics course for makers</h2>
  <p>Creating a robot is a great way to bring people into the field of making - few other projects combine electronics, coding and basic mechanics together in such a natural and engaging way.</p>

  <p>We've had 4 years of experience running robotics courses at the <a href="http://icrobotics.co.uk/">Imperial College Robotics Society</a>, and opening up this course is our way of giving back to the community that has helped us along the way. </p>

      <h4>Affordable</h4>
      <p>Robotics 101 is designed to be as cheap as possible, so everyone can learn robotics. The cost for the whole robot, including Raspberry Pi and battery is less than &pound;30.</p>

      <h4>Expandable</h4>
      <p>Everything about this course is open, and that includes its future. We'd love to see you develop optional additions to 101 robots that build on the functionality we provide.</p>
