[Electronics title]

[Intro]
What is a microcontroller?
Download Arduino IDE if haven't already.

[Background]
What is a breadboard?

Tasks part 1:

* Digital read, digital write
    * Use breadboard button & breadboard LED
* Analog read, analog write
    * Use potential divider on PCB to calculate battery voltage
    * Explain PWM

Explain motor driver basics.

Tasks part 2:

* Use digital and analog write to make motors spin
* Combine with button press to do make robot move on command
* Extra: Use example code to interact with IMU to get yaw. (Notice that robot doesn't go straight, introduce the idea of control)

[Outro]
Physically pressing a button to make the robot move isn't ideal, so in the next session we'll make it remote control.
