## Part 1: Assembly

You will need a few new components to complete the chassis of your robot, so make sure you collect the components in the table below either at the start, or as you progress through the tasks.

| Component   | Quantity    |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| M3 x 8mm    | 12          |
| M3 x 16mm   | 2           |
| M3 Hex Nuts | 4           |
| M3 Spacers  | 2           |
| Chassis     | 1           |
| Breadboard  | 1           |
| Ball wheel  | 1           |
| Motor Brackets    | 2          |
| Breadboard Holder    | 1          |

**Task 0:** Collect components in the table above.

**Task 1:** Place the breadboard in the breadboard holder and attach it to the chassis using two screws. Note that the holes in the 3D printed parts are designed to be tight.

**Task 2:** Attach the ball wheel onto the chassis, note that two nuts will need to be used on the bottom to secure it in place.

**Task 3:** Attach the battery holder to the chassis using two more screws.

**Task 4:** For this step you DO NOT need to unwire your motors and motor driver.

Align the two 3D printed washers with the requisite holes.

Next fit two screws (use the 16 mm screws here) in the holes adjacent to the heatsink on the motor driver. Align this with the washers and lower it into place. Secure it in place by using two nuts on the opposite side. Ensure the heatsink is nearest the end of the robot.

**Task 5:** Screw the motor holders lightly into the board. You will solder and then connect the motors to the motor driver next week.
