## Pre session

Layout the arena and path for the robots, and prepare a small prize or trophy for the winner of the competition.

## During Session

Encourage students to develop code to get their robots around the arena - they are welcome to . After about an hour and a half of students testing their robots, during the last half hour, students let their robots into the arena one by one. We find it kind to allow some leniancy for robots that get stuck - a 10 second penalty for unsticking it normally works well (capped at 5 fixes or so, depending on the course complexity). The fastest robot round the course wins a small prize - we often laser cut a little trophy.

## Post session

Tidy up and debrief
